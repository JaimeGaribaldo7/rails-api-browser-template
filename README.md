My Pokedex Project!

This is my first full stack project. The idea is to be able to view all of the
pokemon available to you and select your favorites to be added to your teams.

Here are the links to my ERD, Wireframes, and user stories:

Planning:

I started by creating wireframes and writing ideas out on paper. I wrote everything in plain English so that I wouldn't worry about the code that I needed to write until I had a plan. Here is a quick look at what my thought process was like:
-First, needed to make sure that I created a table for pokemon to store the 150 options that would be available to the users.
-Next, I had to set the other two tables, Teams, and their JOIN table, Draftings.
-The functions were created at this point, and I made sure that it was made to correspond with my tables in the api.
-When a user clicked on the pokedex button they would be able to view all of their options to be added
to their teams.
-I made each function that made a request to GET, PATCH, POST, and DELETE.
-I then needed to test if the array of pokemon was updating in the database and geting through to the
front end.
-After this I was ready to do the same for the other two tables and follow my user stories as a checklist.
